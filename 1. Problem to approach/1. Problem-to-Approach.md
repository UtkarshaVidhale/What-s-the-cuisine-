# Business Understanding <a id="0"></a>


This is the **Data Science Methodology**, a flowchart that begins with business understanding.

#### Business understanding to helps clarify the goal of the entity asking the question.


#### Looking at this diagram, we immediately spot two outstanding features of the data science methodology.

#### 1. The flowchart is highly iterative. 
#### 2. The flowchart never ends. 


We are interested in automating the process of figuring out the cuisine of a given dish or recipe. Let's apply the business understanding stage to this problem.


It is not a straightforward problem as we need to come up with a way that is very robust to the many cuisines and their variations.


We can determine the cuisine of a dish based on its ingredients. 



 For example:


-   When we talk about **American** cuisines, the first ingredient that comes to one's mind (or at least to my mind =D) is beef or turkey.

-   When we talk about **British** cuisines, the first ingredient that comes to one's mind is haddock or mint sauce.

-   When we talk about **Canadian** cuisines, the first ingredient that comes to one's mind is bacon or poutine.

-   When we talk about **French** cuisines, the first ingredient that comes to one's mind is bread or butter.

-   When we talk about **Italian** cuisines, the first ingredient that comes to one's mind is tomato or ricotta.

-   When we talk about **Japanese** cuisines, the first ingredient that comes to one's mind is seaweed or soy sauce.

-   When we talk about **Chinese** cuisines, the first ingredient that comes to one's mind is ginger or garlic.

-   When we talk about **indian** cuisines, the first ingredient that comes to one's mind is masala or chillis.


# Analytic Approach <a id="2"></a>

Once the business problem has been clearly stated, the data scientist can define the analytic approach to solve the problem. This step entails expressing the problem in the context of statistical and machine-learning techniques, so that the entity or stakeholders with the problem can identify the most suitable techniques for the desired outcome. 


Analytic approach stage is important because it helps identify what type of patterns will be needed to address the question most effectively.



#### Let's explore a machine learning algorithm, decision trees, and see if it is the right technique to automate the process of identifying the cuisine of a given dish or recipe while simultaneously providing us with some insight on why a given recipe is believed to belong to a certain type of cuisine.


This is a decision tree that a naive person might create manually. Starting at the top with all the recipes for all the cuisines in the world, if a recipe contains **rice**, then this decision tree would classify it as a **Japanese** cuisine. Otherwise, it would be classified as not a **Japanese** cuisine.

The above decision tree is not a good example because a plethora of dishes from other cuisines contain rice. Therefore, using rice as the ingredient in the Decision node to split on is not a good choice.



#### In order to build a very powerful decision tree for the recipe case study, let's take some time to learn more about decision trees.


-   Decision trees are built using recursive partitioning to classify the data.
-   When partitioning the data, decision trees use the most predictive feature (ingredient in this case) to split the data.
-   **Predictiveness** is based on decrease in entropy - gain in information, or _impurity_.


#### Suppose that our data is comprised of green triangles and red circles.


The following decision tree would be considered the optimal model for classifying the data into a node for green triangles and a node for red circles.

Each of the classes in the leaf nodes are completely pure â€“ that is, each leaf node only contains datapoints that belong to the same class.


On the other hand, the following decision tree is an example of the worst-case scenario that the model could output. 


<img src="https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DS0103EN/labs/images/lab1_fig7_decision_tree_2.png" width=500>


Each leaf node contains datapoints belonging to the two classes resulting in many datapoints ultimately being misclassified.


#### A tree stops growing at a node when:

-   Pure or nearly pure.
-   No remaining variables on which to further subset the data.
-   The tree has grown to a preselected size limit.


#### Here are some characteristics of decision trees:

Now let's put what we learned about decision trees to use. Let's try and build a much better version of the decision tree for our recipe problem.

The above decision tree is a much better version than the previous one. Although we are still using **Rice** as the ingredient in the first _decision node_, recipes get divided into **Asian Food** and **Non-Asian Food**. **Asian Food** is then further divided into **Japanese** and **Not Japanese** based on the **Wasabi** ingredient. This process of splitting _leaf nodes_ continues until each _leaf node_ is pure, i.e., containing recipes belonging to only one cuisine.


Accordingly, decision trees is a suitable technique or algorithm for our situation.
